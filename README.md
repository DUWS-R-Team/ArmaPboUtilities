# ArmaPboUtilities
A command line utility for creating Arma PBOs

Currently this piece of software is early-access. It is based off the 
[documentation on the community wiki](https://community.bistudio.com/wiki/PBO_File_Format).

# About
This was written in response to my frustration with finding a PBO utility that had output that matched the PBO output
from Arma 3's editor. While trying to track down a [funky issue](https://github.com/DUWS-R-Team/DUWS-R/issues/31) with a 
side project I am working on I decided that having differences in the PBO might be causing my issue. I tried searching for
a PBO utility out there that was either open source or emitted the correct format. I didn't have much. 

In response the lack of tools out there that were open I decided to start one. If you're looking at the earlier commits they
were mainly targeting a minimally viable product. As I can dedicate more time to this I will work on getting it more maintainable.
Logic will be a little less coupled and the unit test coverage will be raised. As always, if you find a bug or something that
I missed feel free to drop me an issue or fork, fix, and make me a pull request :-).
